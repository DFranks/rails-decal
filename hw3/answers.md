1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
Model.create creates an object and saves it to the database whereas Model.new only
creates a new instance of the Model but does not save it.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
Model.save when combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
The column labeled ID exists on every table.

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
Cat.create name: "hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
Trying to not confuse the subtle differences between Python and Ruby syntax. I'm
currently taking CS C8 (Data Science) and I sometimes add colons or forget what
language I'm using (yikes).

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
Eh. It was much more intuitive than the others. I have some background in web development
in PHP and the CodeIgniter framework (based on MVCs) so it's easier for me to pick
up on some of the concepts.

            understand your situation last year haha. Great DeCal thus far (:
